# Authentication
This section will define everything you need to know about authentication within the BÃºho API.

## How to Create a Consumer
A "Comsumer" is the person that is using the API. This terminanology is used to differentiate a "user".

A user is someone that is using the front end of the application.

A consumer is someone that is using the API. e.g. a consumer is you, that is reading this documentation and consuming the API to server to your users.
