# Tournaments
This chapter defines tournaments and their properties.

A tournament is as defined as a competition involving a group of players or teams competing against each other to win a prize or title.
The tournament is played in a series of matches, with the winner of each match advancing to the next round, and the loser being eliminated from the competition.
The tournament continues in this manner until only one player or team remains, who is declared the winner of the tournament.
