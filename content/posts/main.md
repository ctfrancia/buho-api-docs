# Introduction
First of all I would like to thank you for taking the time to read the docs.

Next, I would like to point out that the code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/ctfrancia/buho).

## About
BÃºho, which means "Owl" in spanish, has the aim and goal of being a world wide aggrogator of chess games/tournaments. 
The goal is that if you are in Spain and want to write a front end for creating tournaments in your country/region than you can do so.

### The problem
The creator of this api lives in Barcelona, Spain. In Barcelona there are many clubs in the Capital city of Catalonia, however, communication of the tournaments
are often done through word of mouth or through WhatsApp messages. This is not a good way to communicate to the chess community.

### The solution
The solution to this is to create a back-end aggregator of chess games/tournaments. This way, if you are a front-end developer in Barcelona and you want create 
a front end for your chess club you can do so. Or a front end for your region, or country or world wide, you can do so.
Providing a platform for chess players to find tournaments in their area or in the world allowing for a better community.
